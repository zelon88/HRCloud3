# HRCloud3

This repo is a very early version of a no-sql and cookieless web application with authentication. 
It is intended to replace the WordPress component of [HRCloud2](https://github.com/zelon88/HRCloud2). 

When complete, this one package should be a self contained installation capable of every feature present in HRCloud2 plus the user management features of WordPress, but without a central database. Instead of a database,  HRCloud3 uses cache files which are small, manageable, modular, and repairable in a failure state. 

Feel free to contribute!
