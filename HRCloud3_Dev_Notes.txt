v0.5.6

-I have a bunch of notes and thoughts floating around about how to structure things that I need a consolidated place for it all.
-I wasted some time yesterday re-writing code that looked wrong, but turned out to be completely fine all along.
-The 'DATA' library will be for user-specific xPress dictionaries.
-Separate dictionaries per user are the best way to ensure privacy/security at the expense of compression performance.
-Encryption should utilize user-controlled keys.
-Special functions will need to be developed in dataCore for re-encrypting and verifying files when users change their encryption keys.
-Put some kind of limit on the mechanism for re-encrypting storage, as this poses a huge DDOS risk.
